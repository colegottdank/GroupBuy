# GroupBuy
#### A place where enthusiasts and professional communities can participate in crowd purchasing to get retail products for wholesale prices.

GroupBuy is a standalone application that embeddeds itself in Shopify's CMS while closely communicating with Shopify's REST API. It allows users to manage uniquely categorized GroupBuy 
products enabling additional settings and fields which are necessary to enable crowd purchasing. 

Coded in C#, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Containerized using Docker. Used IdentityModel and SQLServer to store additional fields.
